# Day_04 - Beginner - Randomisation - And - Lists - Summary 🐍

On Day 04 of this Python bootcamp, I learned how to use the **`random`** module to introduce unpredictability into programs. I worked with lists by understanding indexing, offset handling, and appending items, and explored common **`IndexError`** issues while working with nested lists. 

These concepts were reinforced through projects like **Bill Roulette**, **Rock Paper Scissors**, and the **Find Treasure** project, which strengthened my understanding of randomization, list manipulation, and 2D data structures in Python.
