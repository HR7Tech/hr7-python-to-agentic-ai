# Day_01 - Beginner - Variables - Summary 🐍

This session focused on core Python basics, starting with output using the print() function and formatting text with escape sequences such as \n. I practiced string concatenation and learned how to take dynamic user input using the input() function to make programs interactive.

I also explored the len() function to calculate the length of strings and understood how to store inputs and results in variables while following Python’s variable-naming conventions. 

These concepts were applied through small hands-on projects, including a **Band Name Generator** and a **Student ID Card Generator**, reinforcing input handling, string manipulation, and clean output formatting.
