# Day_02 - Beginner - Data Types - Summary  🐍

On Day 02 of my Python bootcamp, I learned about primitive data types, type checking and conversion, mathematical operations, and number formatting using f-strings. 

I applied these concepts by building a **Tip Calculator** and a **Personal Budget and Expense Splitter**, strengthening my understanding of calculations and formatted output in Python.
