# Day 02 – Python Basics (Bootcamp)

On Day 02 of my Python bootcamp, I focused on understanding how Python handles data, performs calculations, and formats output. These concepts are fundamental for building logic-based programs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Python Primitive Data Types
Learned about the basic data types used in Python:
- `int` (Integers)
- `float` (Decimal numbers)
- `str` (Strings)
- `bool` (Booleans)

---

### 2. Type, Error, Type Checking, and Type Conversion
- Understood common type-related errors.
- Learned how to check a variable’s data type using `type()`.
- Converted data types using `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.

---

### 3. Mathematical Operations in Python
Worked with arithmetic operators:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Floor division (`//`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)

---

### 4. Number Manipulation and F-Strings in Python
- Rounded numbers using `round()`.
- Performed calculations with precision.
- Used **f-strings** to format output in a clean and readable way.

## Projects

### Day 02 Project: **Tip Calculator**
A beginner project that calculates the tip amount and splits the bill among people using user input, mathematical operations, and type conversion.

### Day 02 My Project: **Personal Budget and Expense Splitter**
A console-based project that calculates total expenses, remaining balance, and expense percentage using income and expense inputs, reinforcing Day 02 concepts.
