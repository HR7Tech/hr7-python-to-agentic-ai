# Day_03 - Beginner - If/Else - And - Logical_Operators - Summary 🐍

On Day 03 of Python bootcamp, I learned how to control program flow using conditional statements such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`. I practiced nested and multiple conditional checks, used logical operators and the modulo operator.

I applied these concepts by building logic-based projects like **Python Pizza**, **Treasure Island**, and a **Movie Ticket Pricing & Eligibility System**.
