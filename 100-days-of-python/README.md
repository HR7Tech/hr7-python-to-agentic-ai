# 100 Days of Python Challenge 🐍

This folder contains my 100 Days of Python coding journey, following the Angela Yu Python course on Udemy.

Each day includes exercises and projects across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels to progressively strengthen my Python skills. Key parts of the code are commented to explain important logic and decisions.

What’s inside:

🟢 Beginner Level – Fundamentals of Python

🟡 Intermediate Level – More challenging tasks to apply Python concepts

🔵 Advanced Level – Complex exercises and mini-projects to master Python

This folder is meant to document my learning journey and share practical Python examples for others to follow along.
